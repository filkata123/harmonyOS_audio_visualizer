# HarmonyOS Clock Music Visualizer
_A real-time audio visualizer for mobile & desktop built with Unity._

This project is a proof-of-concept UI effect designed for the Huawei TechArena Finland 2025 hackathon.
It demonstrates a simple deforming bubble that surrounds a clock. The bubble reacts to music creating a nice visual effect.

The effect is designed to work on PC and mobile (included builds are for Windows and Android devices for now).

The use case for this visualizer is simply quality-of-life. The developer was motivated by his own desire to have such an effect on his own phone's lock screen when he listens to music. Although there are probably other use-cases that can be envisioned with e.g. mic access.
